This repository contains the TapForms form templates used for subject
tracking in David et al., Genome Biology 2014. To use these forms,
purchase the TapForms app from the iOS store. Next, download this
file and run TapForms. After the app loads, choose to 'Restore' the
database from tapforms_templates.zip. You should now have copies of
the forms used in the study (e.g. Ailments, Bowel Movements, etc.)

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Lawrence David
(l.d@duke.edu).
